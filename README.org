**** Reporting Issues that my code sucks/is bad/should be burnt inside a supernovae explosion

Yeah, you're probably right. But on a serious note, if you see anything that is extremely terrible code-wise do let me
know. I won't accept PRs for code modifications here as this repository is just a mirror, but if you want to open one to
share something new with me or show me how I could do something better I'm totally down and I may even copy your stuff
and cosign you when I merge it into the primary. Best way to learn is to be brought down a peg in my experience, so I'm
open to it.

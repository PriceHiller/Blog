    <p>I can be reached in primarily two locations:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="mailto:price@orion-technologies.io">By
          Email</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/PriceHiller/blog">At the Github repository for this website</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I should take no more than 48 hours to get back to you. If you haven't received a response in 48 hours, please
      send or update a comment with a ping to me. I probably earmarked it and forgot to come back to it or didn't see
      it.

    <p>Hi there! This is the blog and whatever else it may become of Price Hiller. I wrote this bad
      boy in Rust because I apparently have too much time to kill. I also use Neovim... because I
      have too much time to kill. Nix? Yeah, too much time to kill. Yeah, I boot Linux â€” what about

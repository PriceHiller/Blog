    <p>Hello! I'm Price, a Linux user and Neovim addict. This necessarily means I am either bald or balding. Oh, also I
      sometimes write Rust. This page is generated from a Rust static site generator I wrote, gluing a markdown to html
      parser and some syntax magic together to get it up. I'm a big fan of reproducible systems and infrastructure,
      and currently I'm all in on <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. I hold it as a dumb source of pride that I can wipe my laptop
      and have everything back to normal within
      20 minutes depending on how nice Github's rate limit wants to play. Hit me up at my <a
        href="mailto:price@orion-technologies.io">email</a> or on <a
        href="https://github.com/treatybreaker/blog">Github</a> if you want to get in contact.</p>

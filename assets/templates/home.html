  <p>Hello! I'm Price, a Linux user and Neovim addict. This necessarily means I am either bald or balding. Oh, also I
    sometimes write Rust. This page is generated from a Rust static site generator I wrote, it's not very good but it
    makes me happy. I'm a big fan of reproducible systems and infrastructure, though I'm not sure if I'm sold on NixOS
    just yet. I hold it as a dumb source of pride that I can wipe my laptop and have everything back to normal within 20
    minutes depending on how nice Github's rate limit wants to play. Hit me up at my <a
      href="mailto:price@orion-technologies.io">email</a> if you want to get in contact.</p>
